===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

1. To run the game, find the index.html file and double-click it (or open it from within your browser).  The html file will load and run the Javascript files to run the game.

2. Playing the game:
    - Move the player using the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right).
    - The game will not allow you to move off the board.
    - Move across the stone and grass landscape, making your way toward the water.
    - Avoid the bugs. If you collide with a bug, you DIE!
    - If you make it all the way to the water without hitting a bug, you WIN!
